# Hi, I'm Salis 👋
### Software Engineer | Problem Solver | AI-Driven Development

I approach software engineering as a **problem-solving discipline**, not a technology checklist.  
My focus is on understanding business constraints, system behavior, and failure points — then designing solutions that are **scalable, maintainable, and efficient**.

I use modern tools, including **AI-assisted workflows**, to accelerate development without compromising engineering quality.

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset

I believe good software is built by:

- Understanding the **real problem**, not just the requested feature
- Designing systems that **fail gracefully**
- Optimizing for **long-term maintainability**, not short-term speed
- Writing code that is **easy to reason about, debug, and extend**
- Making trade-offs explicit and intentional

Technology choices are outcomes — **not the starting point**.

## 🔍 How I Approach Problems

**1. Clarify the problem**
- What is the actual pain point?
- Who is affected and how often?
- What happens when the system fails?

**2. Break it down**
- Identify boundaries, data flow, and ownership
- Separate concerns: business logic, infrastructure, and presentation

**3. Design the solution**
- Prefer simple, composable designs
- Avoid premature optimization
- Plan for change and scale

**4. Deliver with feedback**
- Ship incrementally
- Measure impact
- Iterate based on real usage

## ⚙️ AI-Driven Development

I use AI as a **force multiplier**, not a replacement for engineering judgment.

- Accelerate boilerplate and repetitive tasks
- Explore multiple solution approaches quickly
- Improve code readability and documentation
- Assist debugging and edge-case discovery

Final decisions, architecture, and responsibility **remain human-owned**.

## 🧭 What You Can Expect From Me

- Clear communication of trade-offs
- Ownership from design to delivery
- Pragmatic decision-making
- Respect for users, systems, and future maintainers
